1) In this repository i have calculated the Equal Monthly Installment for a loan by using  csv files reading and writing functions in python.
2) EMI is a fixed amount made by a borrower to a lender at a specified date each calendar month. I have calcualted EMI for  different combinations of down-payment,amount,rate and durations.
3) For calculating EMI i have taken data from a CSV file that contains information about Loans.
