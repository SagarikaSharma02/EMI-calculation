# EMI_calculation
1) In this repository I have calculated the Equal Monthly Installment for a loan by using  csv files reading and writing functions in python.
2) EMI is a fixed amount made by a borrower to a lender at a specified date each calendar month. I have calculated EMI for different sets of amount, down-payment, rate and duration.
3) For calculating EMI I have taken data from a CSV file that contains information about loans.
